Software Development Plan:

    Requirement Specifications -
        Programming Exercise 6.47. You will be submitting three files: assn10.py, chessboard.py, and plan.txt.
        We are going to modify the requirements a bit from the book. You will prompt the user for input. You will ask
        for the starting location (x, y) and a height and width of the board. You will use this information to draw the
        chessboard (just a single chessboard). Keep in mind that it may not be a square.

        The user must enter the location, but if they do not enter a value for height or width you will use a default
        value of 250. Note, that input() returns an empty string(“”) if the user just hits enter without giving input.
        Here is some code that you must use in your program. It should be placed in a main() function.

    System Analysis -
        Use this if user enters in nothing for width or height:
                    if width == "" and height == "":
                drawChessboard(startX, startY)
            elif height == "":
                drawChessboard(startX, startY, width=eval(width))
            elif width == "":
                drawChessboard(startX, startY, height=eval(height))
            else:
                drawChessboard(startX, startY, eval(width), eval(height))
        I need to make sure that it is all proportional, if the user enters different height and width, then I will need
        to proportion it based off of a 250 X 250 pixels board. height / 8 and width / 8

    System Design -
        1. Ask user for coordinates
        2. Ask user for width
        3. Ask user for height
        4. Draw board first
        5. Draw all individual squares

    Testing -
        Test 1:
            Input: 0, 0
                   Enter
                   Enter
            Output: A board at (0, 0) with a width and height of 250.

        Test 2:
            Input: -100, -200
                   300
                   500
            Output: A board at (-100, -200), with a width of 300, and a height of 500.
