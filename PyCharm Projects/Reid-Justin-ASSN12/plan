SoftwareDevelopment Life Cycle:

Requirement Specifications -
(The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains:

A private int data field named id for the account.
A private float data field named balance for the account.
A private float data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate.
A constructor that creates an account with the specified id (default 0), initial balance (default 100), and annual
interest rate (default 0).
The accessor and mutator methods for id , balance , and annualInterestRate .
A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate.
A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.

System Analysis -
Use this formula to calculate the monthly interest: balance *
monthlyInterestRate . monthlyInterestRate is annualInterestRate / 12 . Note that annualInterestRate is a percent
(like 4.5%). You need to divide it by 100 .)

System Design -
1. get user input
2. display menu
3. let user interact with menu
4. each item on menu is interactable
5. 8 ends the program

Test -
Input: Write a test program that creates an Account object with an account id of 1122, a balance of $20,000, and an annual
interest rate of 4.5%. Use the withdraw method to withdraw $2,500, use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, and print
the id, balance, monthly interest rate, and monthly interest.

Output: 1122, 20000, 4.5%, 1122, 20500, 0,38 %, 76,88 dollars
