Software Development Plan:

Requirement Specifications:
    You will create a program for a brand-new kind of card game. The game is called Gubbins. It is based on two common ways
    to select between two people or teams. You will create a deck of cards that can be used to play the game, as well as
    implement a usage of the cards to show that your deck of cards works properly.

System Analysis:
    When using the sort and search functions, I need to make sure that I'm converting the item of my list into a value or
    id.

System Design:
    1. Intro
    2. Create menu for user (Each item in list is interactable)
        Sort by Value: sorts by card value
        Sort by ID: sort by card id
        Find card: search for card in deck
        New deck: create new deck
        Quit: End function
    3. User can interact with menu

Test:
    Test 1 -
        Sort by value
            values are sorted corrected
    Test 2 -
        New Deck
            New deck is different from old deck
