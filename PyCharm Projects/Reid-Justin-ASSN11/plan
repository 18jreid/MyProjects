Software Development Plan:

    Requirement Specifications -

        You are going to create a program that draws cool patterns. The user will have three modes to choose from:

        Rectangle Pattern - A circular pattern created by drawing multiple rectangles
        Circle Pattern - A circular pattern created by drawing multiple circles
        Super Pattern - A random selection of some number of Rectangle and Circle Patterns

    System Analysis -
        When the user is asked for input, I need to make sure all given values are in terms of floats or integers, no
        strings allowed.

    System Design -
        1. Ask user what mode they want (Rectangle, circle, super pattern).
        2. Ask user for correct input according to what mode they want.
        3. Draw the shapes for the user.

    Test -
        Test 1
            Input: Square
            50 Offset
            200 Height
            100 Width
            60 Count
            45 Rotation
