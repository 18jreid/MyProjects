Software Development Plan:

Requirement Specification -
Create a program that uses Turtle to draw shapes. Show the following menu:

Enter Circle
Enter Rectangle
Remove Shape
Draw Shapes
Exit


Circles – User inputs position, radius, and color. The position is the CENTER of the circle

Rectangles – User inputs position, height, width, color. The position is the lower left-hand corner

Colors – Allow red, yellow, blue, and green only

Remove – Show the number of items in the list and let the user enter a number and remove that shape from the list.
You may assume that they only enter a number within the range that you display.

Draw Shapes – Draw the shapes in the order they are in the list. Clear the screen if shapes had been drawn before.
The color is the fill color of the shape. Shapes are only drawn after this selection, not after entering or removing a
shape.

System Analysis -
I need to make sure that when drawing the circle I make the center of the circle at the coordinates the user enters.
I need to make sure that when removing items from the list i subtract one from the users choice so that it is the one
    they want removed.
I need to make sure I remove all shapes when drawing them.

System Design -
1. Display menu for user.
2. Evaluate user input.
3. Execute selection based off of user input.
4. Repeat the menu to draw again.

Testing -
Test 1:
    Input: Circle, (0, 0), 100, red, draw
    Output: A correct circle drawn around 0, 0 with a radius of 100 and a color of red.

Test 2:
    Input: Circle, (0, 0), 100, red, Circle, (0, 0), 50, green, Circle, (0, 0), 25, blue, Remove, 2, draw
    Output: A large red circle drawn, and a blue circle drawn a fourth of the size, the second circle has been removed.
